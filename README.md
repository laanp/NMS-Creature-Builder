This Excel workbook was created to facilitate management & modification of No Man's Sky pet
information.

The workbook allows import/export of pet information text via the Windows clipboard to/from 
the No Man's Sky Save Game Editor, (by GoatFungus - https://github.com/goatfungus/NMSSaveEditor) 

The workbook configuration form, allows modification of key pet features, including:
	- Creature ID  - (ie; what type of pet)
	- Size
	- Physical attributes (ie; heads, body & tail types, horns eyes, ears scales etc)
	- Pet Name
	- Seeds (ie; primary/secondary colors, textures, bone shape, species and genus) 
	- Fur (flag to set if animal can have fur - not applicable to allpets)
	- Age - (not fully implemented yet)
	- Home Biome (where they are from and where you can induce an egg)
	- Unique ID - This needs to be randomized to ensure your created pet is visible to 
		      other players, the way you made it.
	- Trust, Traits and Mood adjustment sliders (how aggressive, playful or devoted your pet is)

The tool also allows you to save & load preset pet configurations (*.txt) files, that can be opened,
modified and exported to the Windows clipboard, for import into the game save file using the
No Man's Sky Save Game Editor.
